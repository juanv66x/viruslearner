\title{Model Fit Results for CD4 Prediction using a Stacked Ensemble Model}
\format{
A tibble with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{.metric}{Character vector, indicating the evaluation metric (e.g., "rmse" or "rsq")}
\item{.estimator}{Character vector, indicating the type of estimator used (e.g., "standard")}
\item{.estimate}{Numeric vector, the estimated value for each metric}
}
}
\usage{
fens_fit1
}
\description{
This object contains evaluation metrics for a stacked ensemble model used to
predict CD4 T-lymphocyte counts in the test dataset.  The model incorporates
multiple learners through ensemble stacking, achieving high predictive accuracy.
}
\details{
The performance metrics, indicate the model's fit:
\itemize{
\item RMSE: 0.232
\item R²: 0.956
}

These metrics suggest a low prediction error (RMSE) and a high coefficient of
determination (R²), demonstrating a well-fitted model with strong predictive
power for CD4 counts.
